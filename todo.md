// TODO for Trevor:
* full set of videos
* incorrect answers should have a UI indication


//

- Add a cron that will simplify event logs (e.g. merge adjacent watching_video events)

- Handler test data should be in a separate file & should be auto-updated by the tests

- Hardcoded API token for writes

- Add failure case unit tests

- Move server/common/middleware and log to api
- Move server/common/common to lib
